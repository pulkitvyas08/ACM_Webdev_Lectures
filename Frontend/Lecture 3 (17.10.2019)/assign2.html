      <h3>22ND JULY 2019</h3>
      <h4>Dearest all,</h4>
      <p class="para">A College Is A New Beginning In Any Students Life. After The Much Disciplined Life Of Schools There Comes The College. It Gives Us A Sense Of Responsibility As Well As Freedom. We Suddenly Start Thinking That Woo We Are Actually Grown Up Wand That Now We Can Do Anything And Everything. We Feel Like A Free Bird.My first day at college had a great meaning to me. It was the beginning of my dream to go to college and to pursue a higher education.I had so many emotions running trough me , it was the first time being in this level and the first time paying  for  education  myself.  I always wanted to be a college student, a serious student who would decide what to be in her life. The first year of my freshman year and Fall semester. That day I had so many things on my mind, from what I was going to wear to figure out where the class number and the floor it would be located at.  It was actually a day full of new experiences. Everyone was very excited and meeting people from different parts of the country. And getting to know the culture and tradition of various people.<br>It was also the day when many people were alloted their dorm rooms, and meeting their fellow roommates. </p>
      <h4>So yeah...it was a great day. And then on usual daily routine and fun as well as studies continued on....</h4>
